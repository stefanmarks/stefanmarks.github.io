<h1>Description</h1>

This project is a 3D model of an architectural design previsualisation that can be viewed on a phone or in a browser, and also placed in the real environment via Augmented Reality.
The 3D model was created as part of a master thesis and processed by me to create an AR experience that can be shown during the examination.
