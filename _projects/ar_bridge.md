<h2>Description</h2>

This project is a 3D model of a bridge that can be viewed on a phone or in a browser, and also placed in the real environment via Augmented Reality.
The project was initiated by AUTs engineering department who had developed a bridge in a suitcase that can be shown in schools.
The CAD model provided was processed by me to create an AR experience that the students can "take home".
