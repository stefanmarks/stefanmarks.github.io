This project is a 3D model of a bridge that can be viewed on a phone or in a browser, and also placed in the real environment via Augmented Reality.
The project was initiated by AUTs engineering department who had developed a bridge in a suitcase that can be shown in schools. 
The CAD model provided was processed by me to make an AR experience the students can "take home".
