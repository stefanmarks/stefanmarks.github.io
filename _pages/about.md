I am Associate Professor at the <a href="https://aut.ac.nz" target="_blank">Auckland University of Technology</a>, New Zealand.

I lecture Creative Technologies at <a href="https://www.aut.ac.nz/study/study-options/architecture-and-built-environment" target="_blank">Huri Te Ao/School of Future Environments</a>.

My main areas of research are collaborative extended reality (XR) and data visualisation.
I combine these interests in my function as director of Sentience Lab, a facility for the development of immersive, multimodal and multisensory data visualisation and interaction.

I have eight years of industry experience as a hardware and software developer.

I have a Diplom of Microinformatics and a Master’s Degree in Human-Computer Interaction from the <a href="https://www.w-hs.de/" target="_blank">Westfälische Hochschule</a> in Germany.
In New Zealand, I received my PhD from <a href="https://auckland.ac.nz" target="_blank">The University of Auckland</a>, a Certificate of Tertiary Education from Auckland University of Technology, and I qualified as a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (HEA).

In my free time, I enjoy nature photography, ornithology, volunteering for conservation work, and the great NZ outdoors.
